Velox: Meta's Unified Execution Engine

### Overview:

- Meta had many specialized engines for different types of data processing workloads.
  This resulted in duplication of effort and inconsistent interfaces for users.
- Velox is a C++ library that provides reusable, extensible, and high-performance
  data processing components which teams can use to build execution engines in their
  specific data management systems. It aims to solve the issues of the siloed
  data ecosystem Meta observed.
- Velox takes a fully optimized query plan as input and performs the computation
  described by that plan in the local node. It does not contain a language front end, nor a
  global query optimizer -- it is built specifically to be an execution engine.

### Key takeaways:

- Provides the following high level components: Type, Vector,
  Expression Evaluation, Functions, Operators, I/O, Serializers,
  and Resource Management. Users can choose what they need and customize functionality
  using its extensibility APIs.
- Velox plays the role of an execution engine in a modular data management system.

### System evaluated:

- Presto -- Meta's distributed query engine, Presto with Velox as its execution engine

### Workloads/Benchmarks

- TPC-H and real workloads from production traffic in their company
